# Giga-GPT2
Giga-GPT2 is an AI model that is being developed using GPT2 and TensorFlow. The project's goal is to create multiple AI models that have similarities to myself and my friends by training them on our direct messages. The models will also be trained on various datasets available on Hugging Face (for now, only the Wikipedia dataset is being used) to add intelligence to the models.

Each of the Giga-GPT2 models has been turned into a Discord bot using the discord.py library. By adding these bots to a Discord server, users can interact with the AI models in real-time through messages.

## Project Goals
This project is an exploratory effort to learn more about GPT and TensorFlow and to gain insights into the inner workings of AI models. The main objectives of the project are:

-To learn how to build and train AI models using GPT2 and TensorFlow

-To explore the capabilities and limitations of GPT2

-To create AI models that are capable of producing text that resembles the writing styles of myself and my friends

-To gain insights into the process of fine-tuning pre-trained language models on custom datasets

-To find out how Discord bots operate and interact with users

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, I used:

-Python 3.10

-TensorFlow 2.10

-Transformers library from Hugging Face

-A dataset of direct messages

-Discord.py 2.2.2

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the work of many researchers and developers who have contributed to the development of GPT2 and TensorFlow. Special thanks go to the developers of Hugging Face, who have made it possible to use and fine-tune pre-trained language models with ease.
