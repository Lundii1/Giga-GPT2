# Giga-GPT2

A **TensorFlow- and GPT-2-powered AI model training system** for creating personalized chatbots that emulate real conversational styles and personalities.  
Each model is fine-tuned on custom datasets, including personal text data and public resources like Wikipedia, and deployed as a live **Discord bot** for interactive chat.

---

## Overview

**Giga-GPT2** explores how fine-tuned language models can replicate unique writing styles while maintaining general conversational intelligence.  
By combining **GPT-2**, **TensorFlow**, and **Discord integration**, this project demonstrates how custom AI models can be built, trained, and deployed in real-world, interactive environments.

Each fine-tuned model represents a distinct personality, trained on a mix of **direct messages** and **public datasets** to balance realism with linguistic depth.  
Users can interact with these AI personas directly through Discord, where each bot operates as a standalone conversational model.

## Features

🧠 **Custom AI Personas:** Fine-tune GPT-2 models to reflect specific conversational styles  
💬 **Discord Integration:** Engage with trained models in real time via Discord messages  
⚙️ **TensorFlow & Hugging Face Support:** Built on robust machine-learning frameworks  
📚 **Dataset Blending:** Combine private text data with open datasets like Wikipedia  
🔄 **Live Model Interaction:** Deploy and communicate with models in real time  
🔓 **Open Source:** Fully transparent and modifiable for research or experimentation

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lundii1/Giga-GPT2.git
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install tensorflow transformers datasets discord.py==2.2.2 pyarrow
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Run a training script to fine-tune a model on your dataset:
```bash
python lundii_trainer.py
```

Once training is complete, launch the Discord bot to interact with your AI persona:
```bash
python discordLundii.py
```

### What It Does
- Loads your training data (from `/data`)  
- Fine-tunes GPT-2 on your dataset  
- Saves the trained model to `/output`  
- Connects to Discord and allows real-time chat interaction  

---

## Configuration

### Data
- Place all text datasets in the `/data` folder (e.g., `dms.txt`, `Wikipedia.txt`, etc.).  
- Each persona (e.g., “Lundii”, “Pete”) has its own `.txt` file containing relevant text samples.

### Discord Setup
1. Create a new Discord bot via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
2. Copy your bot token and paste it into the corresponding bot script (e.g., `discordLundii.py`).  
3. Invite the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL generated by Discord.
